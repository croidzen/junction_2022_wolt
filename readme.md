# Junction Hackathon 2022: Wolt Challenge

## Mockup to Show the Combinatoion of Multiple Wolt Deliveries

A Wolt delivery usually takes two rides/ways: One to the pickup address and another one to the destionation. To reduce the number of rides per delivery, we can
- Offer to deliver further items, that can be picked up on the route of the existing delivery
- Offer to deliver items away form the customer, after he/she received the existing delivery

By combining deliveries in this way, we can do 3 deliveries with only 3 rides/ways.
